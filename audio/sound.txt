the speaker that we are using is connected to the pi via analog
im using alsamixer that is already pre installed in our pi

1. change the sound card to the analog's
$ alsamixer
$ f6
$ pick analog

2. the speaker volume is way too soft and u can barely hear at 100%, so lets bump it up
(remember to do ur apt-get update/upgrade)
(best to reboot after all these)
$ sudo apt-get install pulseaudio pavucontrol
$ pactl list | grep 'Sink'
above command list ur sound interfaces, it should be '1' for your analog interface by default
$ pactl -- set-sink-volume 1 +200%
replace '1' with number of your choice if necessary

3. test sound
to test the sound you can play some wav files that should already exist in your pi
$ aplay /usr/share/scratch/Media/Sounds/Vocals/Singer2.wav

3.1 troubleshooting, force it to set analog as default sound card
$ sudo nano /etc/asound.conf
content in file:
defaults.pcm.card 1
defaults.ctl.card 1

3.2 troubleshooting, force it to set analog as default sound card via pulseaudio
$ pacmd set-default-sink 1

3.3 troubleshooting, please sudo reboot your pi
3.4 troubleshooting, please make sure u plug in the speaker properly
take it out and plug it back in.

4. get it to say stuff
for this we will be using espeak
$ sudo apt-get install espeak
$ espeal "aaaaaa hello world" 2>/dev/null

5. for usage in your own python files, add the following lines:
"from audio/speakText import speakText"
"speakText("what u want to say")"


for mic input
this is done with a USB mic

1. check if ur mic is in the list
$ arecord -l
u want the card number and device number from the listing
mine:
card 2: AT2020USB [AT2020USB+], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
  
2. edit the config file
$ nano /home/pi/.asoundrc
add this portion in
pcm.mic {
  type plug
  slave {
    pcm "hw:[card number],[device number]"
  }
}

3. test by recording somethng
$ arecord --format=S16_LE --rate=16000 --file-type=wav out.wav
$ aplay out.wav

4. for usage in your own python files, add the following lines:
"from audio/recordSound.py import recordSound, playSound"
"recordSound(output, duration)" where output is a string and duration is an int for seconds

to do...
